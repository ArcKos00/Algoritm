The Coctail Shake Sort Algorithm O(n^2)

The cocktail shaker sort algorithm with reflection (Cocktail Shaker Sort) is an improved variant of the usual bubble sort algorithm, which works faster in certain cases. This algorithm is also called shuffle sort algorithm.

The basic idea is that the algorithm moves through the array from left to right, just like a normal bubble sort algorithm, and then goes back from right to left, checking the elements from the end of the array. This process continues until all elements of the array are sorted.
