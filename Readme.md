The Ring Sort Algoritm O(n^2)

Ring Sort is a sorting algorithm used to sort arrays with numeric values or objects with key values. This algorithm refers to comparative sorting, and its complexity is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array.

The ring sorting algorithm is based on a technique called "ring". In this technique, the elements of the array are arranged on a circle, and the sort order is determined using two variables - the index of the start and end of the ring. The initial value of the start index is 0, and the end index is n-1, where n is the number of elements in the array.

The main idea of the algorithm is to rotate the ring with array elements until the sorting conditions are satisfied. This means that we go through the ring from the beginning to the end and compare two adjacent elements. If the first element is larger than the next one, then we change their places, otherwise we continue going around the ring. If we have passed the ring without any changes, then the sorting is completed.
